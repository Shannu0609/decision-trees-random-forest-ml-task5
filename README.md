Machine Learning Task 5 – Decision Trees &amp; Random Forests
This project demonstrates how to build, visualize, and evaluate **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** models for classification.  
All tasks are completed in **Google Colab** using **Scikit-learn** and **Graphviz**.

### **Objective**
To understand and implement tree-based machine learning models:
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier  
and evaluate them using cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance.
